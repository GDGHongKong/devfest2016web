    "description": "This codelab will teach you how to embed 360 degree VR media into websites using VR View. This technology is designed for developers of traditional apps to enhance them with immersive content. For example, VR view makes it easy for a travel app to provide viewers with an underwater scuba diving tour as they plan vacation or for a home builder to take prospective buyers on virtual walkthrough before the home is built. VR View is available not only on web pages, but also for Android and iOS. There is a companion codelab to this one which introduces VR view in Android.",
